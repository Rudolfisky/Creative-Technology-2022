# Creative-Technology-2022
A repo to keep track of my progress during my semester.

# Personal learning goals/aspirations
For as long as I can remember I have been able to come up with creative concepts. Whether it was for a school related project or something more personal.
This Semester want to focus prototyping my wacky ideas and working on form alongside function. I want to make my projects to not only function, but look dashing as well. During my semester I will also be looking into doing more research relating to my project. this research could be looking at existing solutions to finding the best technology to apply to a project.
