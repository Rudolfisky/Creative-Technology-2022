# A.L.N.D. (Duo project) 
The A.L.N.D. (Automatic Long-distance Nut Dispenser) is a project idea Rik and me cooked up. 

I highly suggest you read up on the project [here](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND).

I completely understand if that doesn't seem appealing too read most of the main Readme.<br/> 
I had to rework this page last minute because my partner didn't update it weeks before like we arranged.<br/> 
But more on our duo partnership later.

# Wat did I work on?

## Shooting activation UX Research
Early on in the project we decided to do some UX research on the shooting activation part of the project.<br/> 
The main research file is 
[here, in the research documentation](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Research/UI%20Manual%20or%20Auto%20activation%20MK1.md)

Before starting the tests, we thought users would've been more interested in seeing some sort of system that would activate when the user opens their mouth, we were wrong.

In essence, we learned that the average user prefers manual over facial activation.<br/> 
We decided that this wouldn't really fit the Impact of our project so we still decided on the the facial activation.

We sadly couldn't realize this part of the project due to a couple reasons.

1. I was too focused on getting the shooting mechanism working.
2. I had trouble communicating and refining the needs of the project with my partner (check **partnership** header).

To sum up the last reason without already going into detail

## Shooting mechanism

[Documentation on how the development of this went](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Research/Shooting%20Mechanism.md)

The shooting mechanism is what I mainly focused on during the project. Although I am happy with some of the results, some I am not.<br/> 
The shooting mechanism started to take more time and I started to get tunnel visioned on the shooting mechanism, ignoring the other possible prototypes I could've worked on (aiming mechanism, activation mechanism or even a reloading mechanism). 

Even though I had a lot of fun working on the shooting mechanism, I missed another crucial development point.<br/> 
I realized this a bit too late, but I ended up not being able to add electronic and programable components to the the shooting mechanism.<br/> 
I pretty much worked on a piece of wood making my work seem like arts and crafts. 

If I could do things differently, would divert my focus on other components, like the ones mentioned earlier

## Presentation
![Presentation](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/raw/main/Media/Demo/Demo%20setup%201.jpg)

My partner focused on the media aspect of this project.<br/> 
He made both the poster, presentational plaques, and artwork for the final demo.<br/> 
Together we presented our project like a serious product and focused on creating our desired impact.

[Here is a report on the presentational demo](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Presentation.md)

# Partnership
ne of the main problems plaguing this project was my tunnel vision.<br/> 
The other problem was linked to the duo aspect of the project.<br/> 

The core problem we had was bad communication.<br/> 
At the start of the project, everything seemed fine, but as time progressed we started communicating less and less.

When we had to present our concepts to the teachers and other students, not only did he not show, he told me halfway throughout the day that he was not going to make it because he was still in Amsterdam.<br/> 

After that he was sick for a week.<br/> 
Being sick is not a crime, it's very human.<br/> 
But it becomes a problem when you don't communicate this with your partner.<br/> 

After this it seemed really clear to that we both had different working ethics.<br/> 
I really wanted to work onsite because I feel more motivated onsite and I was working with the laser cuter a lot.<br/> 
But my partner liked to work from home.<br/> 

During this period we had almost no online communication.<br/> 
This meant we had no idea what the other person was working on most of the time.<br/> 
This ties into the fact that some documentation that my partner was supposed to do he uploaded last minute (couple of days before portfolio deadline).<br/> 
That and he missed a couple of documents (Readme and UX design) which is had to update last minute.

## In hindsight
I feel like the following points sum it up quite well
- Poor communication
- Difference in locational preference

This could've gone better if we decided to work more AGILE (standups) and communicate on a more daily basis.<br/> 
During my next project I will be sure to focus more on communication within the team.

# Conclusion
I would say this project had both success and failures.

**Success** in the sense that the projects impact was successfully had in our final demo.<br/> 
The people that saw our product, demo, and presentational posters were questioning the use of our technology and automation as a whole (which is good).

**Less successful** were our working ethics as a group/partnership and my personal tunnel vision on the shooting mechanism.

This project mostly felt like a longer personal then a duo project based on our lack of communication.

## What to do differently 

If I focused more on making a variety of prototypes I would've made more a technological focused impact.<br/>
In order to achieve this I need to step back every once in a while to look at the bigger picture of the project and see where I'm headed.

I will also focus on applying more AGILE methods into my group projects. Using methods like standups and sprints I can create better communication and an overall better experience for future projects.

I should also Focus more on communication my progress with teachers.<br/> 
Doing so will help steer me in the right direction when problems like tunnel vision or bad group communication occur.
