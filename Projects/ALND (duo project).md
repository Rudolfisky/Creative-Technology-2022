# A.L.N.D. (Duo project) 
The A.L.N.D. (Automatic Long-distance Nut Dispenser) is a project idea Rik and me cooked up. 

I highly suggest you read up on the project [here](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND).

I completely understand if that doesn't seem appealing too read most of the main Readme.<br/> 
I had to rework this page last minute because my partner didn't update it weeks before like we arranged.<br/> 
But more on our duo partnership later.

# Wat did I work on?

## Shooting activation UX Research
Early on in the project we decided to do some UX research on the shooting activation part of the project.<br/> 
The main research file is 
[here, in the research documentation](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Research/UI%20Manual%20or%20Auto%20activation%20MK1.md)

Before starting the tests, we thought users would've been more interested in seeing some sort of system that would activate when the user opens their mouth, we were wrong.

In essence, we learned that the average user prefers manual over facial activation.<br/> 
We decided that this wouldn't really fit the Impact of our project so we still decided on the the facial activation.

We sadly couldn't realize this part of the project due to a couple reasons.

1. I was too focused on getting the shooting mechanism working.
2. I had trouble communicating and refining the needs of the project with my partner (check **partnership** header).

To sum up the last reason without already going into detail

## Shooting mechanism

[Documentation on how the development of this went](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Research/Shooting%20Mechanism.md)

The shooting mechanism is what I mainly focused on during the project. Although I am happy with some of the results, some I am not.<br/> 
The shooting mechanism started to take more time and I started to get tunnel visioned on the shooting mechanism, ignoring the other possible prototypes I could've worked on (aiming mechanism, activation mechanism or even a reloading mechanism). 

Even though I had a lot of fun working on the shooting mechanism, I missed another crucial development point.<br/> 
I realized this a bit too late, but I ended up not being able to add electronic and programable components to the the shooting mechanism.<br/> 
I pretty much worked on a piece of wood making my work seem like arts and crafts. 

If I could do things differently, would divert my focus on other components, like the ones mentioned earlier

## Presentation
My partner focused on the media aspect of this project.<br/> 
He made both the poster, presentational plaques, and artwork for the final demo.<br/> 
Together we presented our project like a serious product and focused on creating our desired impact.

[Here is a report on the presentational demo](../../ALND/Presentation.md)

# Partnership
- near no communication in general or on onsite availability
- working alone most of the time
- excuses for not showing up seemed endless

One of the main problems plaguing this project was my tunnel vision.<br/> 
The other 

# Conclusion
I would say this project had both success and failures.

**Success** in the sense that the projects impact was successfully had in our final demo (
[read more on that here](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Presentation.md)
).<br/> 
The people that saw our product, demo, and presentational posters were questioning the use of our technology and automation as a whole (which is good).

**Less successful** were our working ethics as a group/partnership and my personal tunnel vision on the shooting mechanism.

This project mostly felt like a longer personal then a duo project based on our lack of communication.

## What to do differently 

If I focused more on making a variety of prototypes I would've made more a technological impact.<br/>
Combining this with better partnership arrangements would've made for a better project outcome.
