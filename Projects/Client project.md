# Innovative in-store jumbo experience

## Process
T.B.F. with a chronological approach to my project

#START OLD VISION<br/>
My personal vision has become more solid throughout this project. My 2 previous projects mainly focused on satirization of technologies or subjects (automation and laziness). This client project took a different turn however. Our client showed us some really cool current and past project they worked on. A lot of their project focused on creating interactive in-store experiences that either mimic online shopping features or creating completely new solutions. I really liked the potential of these projects and the results. The Interactive Porche experience is a really cool solution for instance.

This experience was made to give Porche costumers an interactive car customization experience in-store creating upselling of car modifications.

Initially we started with our client project from the perspective of the shoppers. This meant that we completely forgot to include the value our solution would create for the Jumbo as a company. We had to shift our project to include the promotion of products the jumbo wanted the costumer to buy.

This shift in direction didn't sit well with me however. Although I do understand the fact that we needed to create value for the Jumbo, I also feel wrong advertising products to costumers with jumbos interest in mind (opposed to the costumers).

Based on the feedback that we should focus more on jumbo's gains, we modified our [value proposition](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z) to include more gains for the Jumbo (like upselling).

## Learning outcomes
The things that directly impact my learning outcomes summed up.

### Vision
*You express your own vision on future scenarios through research of the evolution of mankind’s relationship with technology.*

#### Process
My personal vision on this project, future, and product owner.

This project we worked on creating a positive costumer in-store interactive experience whilst also adding value for the jumbo. I personally really love the idea of creating interactive in-store experiences that are either based on existing online store features or add a completely new experience that is only available in-store.

This First Impression project shows of really well what I mean. I believe that stores could greatly profit from making an webstore activity, like customizing a car, one you could do in a physical store. Not only does this add value, but it will create more costumer-brand loyalty.

In the future I hope to see many more interactive in-store empierces (and maybe even work on them). In an ideal world, each store would have interactive solutions to help the costumer select product like cars, pants or even perfume.

#### Deliverables



### Innovative concept
*You discover and define an innovative concept using creative thinking techniques combined with research of technology, context and human.*

#### Process
![first brainstorm](../Media/Client%20Project/initial%20brainstorm.jpg)

After our team's first brainstorm session, we decided to look into certain technologies and themes that we could focus on during this project.

Initially we focused on one specific impact:

*Create awareness for alternate ways of shopping for customers in store.*

This Impact we'd attempt to achieve by recommending in-store shoppers products that are either more relevant to them then the ones they are thinking of buying, or by showing alternate products and their differences (cheaper, healthier, and or climate impact). After communicating this concept to the product owner and teacher, we got asked to focus on a specific target group, like Vegans.

Based on our concept we started to define questions we'd need answers to to strengthen our concept. we decided to spend time on the following:

- How can we personalize the in-store shopping experience?

- [What Technology should we use to implement our concept?](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)

- How do we persuade shoppers to buy additional products?

Answers to these questions would not only strengthen our concept, but also prove to be useful for information gathering. After having done the "[What Technology should we use to implement our concept?](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)" research, Me and my group mates came together to discus our findings and define our requirements ([Defining our concept and impact](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)).

### Interactive user experience
*You design an experimental interactive user experience that investigates a technology’s potential and its mutual effect on people.*

#### Process


#### Deliverables


### Prototypes
*You collaboratively realize and test a series of prototypes and its potential, for both users and stakeholders, in real-world application.*

#### Process


#### Deliverables


### Present
*You present your research outcomes, prototypes and reflections in relation to your research, concept and vision, to stakeholders, peers and potential future employers.*

### Personal growth
*You articulate your professional ambitions and focus and demonstrate your efforts and growth within the roles you fulfill in your projects.*
