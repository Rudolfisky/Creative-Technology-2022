# Innovative in-store jumbo experience

## Process
T.B.F. with a chronological approach to my project

## Learning outcomes
The things that directly impact my learning outcomes summed up.

### Vision
*You express your own vision on future scenarios through research of the evolution of mankind’s relationship with technology.*

#### Process
My personal vision has become more solid throughout this project. My 2 previous projects mainly focused on satirization of technologies or subjects (automation and laziness). This client project took a different turn however. Our client showed us some really cool current and past project they worked on. A lot of their project focused on creating interactive in-store experiences that either mimic online shopping features or creating completely new solutions. I really liked the potential of these projects and the results. The Interactive Porche experience is a really cool solution for instance.

This experience was made to give Porche costumers an interactive car customization experience in-store creating upselling of car modifications.

Initially we started with our client project from the perspective of the shoppers. This meant that we completely forgot to include the value our solution would create for the Jumbo as a company. We had to shift our project to include the promotion of products the jumbo wanted the costumer to buy.

This shift in direction didn't sit well with me however. Although I do understand the fact that we needed to create value for the Jumbo, I also feel wrong advertising products to costumers with jumbos interest in mind (opposed to the costumers).

Based on the feedback that we should focus more on jumbo's gains, we modified our [value proposition](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z) to include more gains for the Jumbo (like upselling).

### Innovative concept
*You discover and define an innovative concept using creative thinking techniques combined with research of technology, context and human.*

#### Process
HOW DID WE GET OUR CONCEPT?

DEFINING OUR ORIGINAL IMPACT

DOING RESEARCH BASED ON OUR IMPACT
Based on our concept we started to define questions we'd need answers to to strengthen our concept. we decided to spend time on the following:

- How can we personalize the in-store shopping experience?

- [What Technology should we use to implement our concept?](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)

- How do we persuade shoppers to buy additional products?

Answers to these questions would not only strengthen our concept, but also prove to be useful for information gathering. After having done the "[What Technology should we use to implement our concept?](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)" research, Me and my group mates came together to discus our findings and define our requirements ([Defining our concept and impact](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)).
