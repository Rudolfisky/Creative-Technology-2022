# Innovative in-store jumbo experience

This project is the a client project for First Impression(FI). We were tasked with creating a interactive in-store user experience.

## Process

This project started out with a lot of ideation. after brainstorming a bunch of different Technologies and idea's

![first brainstorm](../Media/Client%20Project/initial%20brainstorm%20%20no%20GJ.jpg)

After this initial brainstorm, we decided to do research on the following subjects:
-   Navigation within jumbo
-   Product recommendation 
-   Gamification
-   AR (Augmented Reality)

After doing preliminary research on some of these subjects we focused on the recommendation concept and creating an impact surrounding the concept:

*Create awareness for alternate ways of shopping for customers in store.*

This is also the concept me and Stefan presented our [First demo](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z) at our first demo. We also Thought it would've been interesting to keep in a navigational aspect in the presentation [story board](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z). We stopped focusing on this due to the change in concept focus.

After the presentation we did a [Retrospective](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z) in which we outlined our next sprint goal as well as problems within the group and how we can achieve positive change.

During sprint 2 we tried focusing on Strengthening our concept and realizing an interactive demo. 

Based on our concept a smaller group (me included) started to define questions we'd need answers to to strengthen our concept. we decided to spend time on the following:

- How can we personalize the in-store shopping experience?

- [What Technology should we use to implement our concept?](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)

- How do we persuade shoppers to buy additional products?

Answers to these questions would not only strengthen our concept, but also prove to be useful for information gathering. After having done the "[What Technology should we use to implement our concept?](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)" literature  and available product research, Me and my group mates came together to discus our findings and define our requirements ([Defining our concept and impact](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z)).

During this sprint we also started working on interactive prototypes. We started of by researching, creating designs, refining them into prototypes, and repeating [this process](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z). I focused on creating an intuitive way to access the scanning functionality. Whilst testing, I did some testing regarding the "contextual awareness" idea GJ brought up. I tested this at the start of my [second prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/mfSndr4DXEdiwT20qK9E4Z/Jumbo-app-proto-1?node-id=0%3A1&t=hQtjfRUIkhsC8hD1-0)s user tests. Every tester was excited about this idea, maybe even more so then the actual concept.

Others from the group where also focusing on designing parts of our concept. I contrast to my peers, focused on how the user wants to interact with the scanner whilst my peers focused on iterating recommendation systems.

During the final week of Sprint 2 things got a bit more hectic. We started working on a [interactive demo](https://www.figma.com/file/5PxU9PetiykBcUj1u8ToSW/Interactive-Demo?node-id=75%3A429&t=vB9owuHeVEm0bTxH-0) and a infograph to help us present our sprint deliveries. This process made me stress a bit due to time related pressure due to the busy week (portfolio and sprint 2 deliveries).

After the 2nd sprint delivery we realized we needed to head into a different direction with the project. 

## Learning outcomes
The things that directly impact my learning outcomes summed up.

### [Vision](../Learning%20Outcomes/1%20Vision.md)
*You express your own vision on future scenarios through research of the evolution of mankind’s relationship with technology.*

<!-- #### Process
My personal vision on this project, future, and product owner.

This project we worked on creating a positive costumer in-store interactive experience whilst also adding value for the jumbo. I personally really love the idea of creating interactive in-store experiences that are either based on existing online store features or add a completely new experience that is only available in-store.

![Porche Interactive experience](../Media/Client%20Project/Porche%20IE.jpg)

This First Impression project (Client project) is a great example of my personal vision. I believe that stores could greatly profit from making an webstore activity, like customizing a car, one you could do in a physical store. Not only does this add value, but it will create more costumer-brand loyalty.

In the future I hope to see many more interactive in-store experiences (and maybe even work on them). In an ideal world, each store would have interactive solutions to help the customer select product like cars, pants or even perfume. -->
