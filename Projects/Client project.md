# Innovative in-store jumbo experience
## Process
T.B.F. with a chronological approach to my project

## Learning outcomes
The things that directly impact my learning outcomes summed up.

### Vision
*You express your own vision on future scenarios through research of the evolution of mankind’s relationship with technology.*

#### process
My personal vision has become more solid throughout this project. <br/> 
My 2 previous projects mainly focused on satirization of technologies or subjects (automation and laziness). <br/>
This project took a different turn however. <br/>
During the project I came in contact with some of our client, First Impression, projects. <br/>
A lot of their project focused on creating interactive in-store experiences that either mimic online shopping features or creating completely new solutions. <br/>
I really liked the potential of these projects and the results. <br/>
On the other hand, I disliked some aspects relating to our personal project. <br/>
For instance, I didn't like the idea of creating advertisements or promoting products based on jumbo's needs. <br/>
I felt that it was much more interesting to try and create a good experience for the costumer rather then creating more sales via altered product recommendation.<br/>
I do however recognize the fact that there needs to be value to a solution in order for jumbo to want to invest in the solution. <br/>
