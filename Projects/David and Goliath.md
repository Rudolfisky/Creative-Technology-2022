# David and Goliath (super useless box+ deluxe)
This project was made for the personal project period of my semester. The Concept consists of a set of useless boxes that interact with eachother via a switch. One box would be bigger (Goliath) and one would be smaller (David)

# Vision
The vision of this project was quite simple: How Do i make someone laugh, think using a wacky peace of technology?
Using David and Goliath i could do just that. I would essentially be grabbing a piece of useless technology and make it seemingly more useless by automating/removing the interaction, making it even more useless. One could also descibe this as a parody of automation.

# Execution
## What am i getting myself into?
I first started on researching useless boxes in order to see how they work. Ppoiler alert, they work incredibly simple.<br/>

After feeling sufficiently informed, I started designing my own arm.<br/>

While the ISSD where busy deciding weather to print my designs or not, I was busy getting aquinted with what kind of technology I wanted to use to power my arm. In my case, these where servos.<br/>

After becoming impatient with the 3d printing prototy procces I decided to take a more simple aproach. So I redesigned the arm to be lasercut using plywood and started putting them togther.

After all this I started to work on making a housing to fit the servo and a switch.<br/>

Meanwhile, i was spending time at home painting Goliath.

Then spend 10 to 7 working on getting the whole servo/switch casing to be perfect.

And last but deffinetly not least, putting everything together

# Retrospect
in heinsight I must admit that I didn't know what I could realize in a weeks time. That being said, I'm really glad I got a chance to give it my all and make something the way I wanted it to. I believe, that given more time, i shoul have been able to also finish David(the smaller box) and finish the project completely. but I'm still really happy i got focus on prototyping, thinking of wacky ideas.
