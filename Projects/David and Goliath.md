# David and Goliath (super useless box+ deluxe)
This project was made for the personal project period of my semester. The Concept consists of a set of useless boxes that interact with each other via a switch. One box would be bigger (Goliath) and one would be smaller (David)

# Vision
The vision of this project was quite simple: How Do i make someone laugh, think using a wacky peace of technology?
Using David and Goliath i could do just that. I would essentially be grabbing a piece of useless technology and make it seemingly more useless by automating/removing the interaction, making it even more useless. One could also describe this as a parody of automation.

# Execution
## What am i getting myself into?
I first started on researching useless boxes in order to see how they work. Spoiler alert, they work incredibly simple.<br/>

After feeling sufficiently informed, I started designing my own arm.<br/>

While the ISSD where busy deciding weather to print my designs or not, I was busy getting acquainted with what kind of technology I wanted to use to power my arm. In my case, these where servos.<br/>

After becoming impatient with the 3d printing prototyping process I decided to take a more simple approach. So I redesigned the arm to be lasercut using plywood and started putting them together.

After all this I started to work on making a housing to fit the servo and a switch.<br/>

Meanwhile, I was spending time at home painting Goliath. This might seem odd but bear with me. One of my personal goals during this semester is to not only achieve functional requirements, but also work on the form/presentation of my projects.

 I then spend from 10 to 7 working on getting the whole servo/switch casing to be perfect. It needed to fit together as well as fit inside the box. As you can see, I had to modify the arm a little bit in order for my arm to be able to press the switch

And last but definitely not least, putting everything together.

# Retrospect
in hindsight I must admit that I didn't know what I could realize in a weeks time. That being said, I'm really glad I got a chance to give it my all and work on project with dedication and perseverance. I believe, that given more time, I should have been able to also finish David(the smaller box) and finish the project completely. but I'm still really happy I got to focus on prototyping, thinking of wacky ideas and making the existing results look presentable.
