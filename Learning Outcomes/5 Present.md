# Present
*You present your research outcomes, prototypes and reflections in relation to your research, concept and vision, to stakeholders, peers and potential future employers.*

<hr/>

## Present 
*showing a visually appealing summary of your work, i.e. in an exhibition and/or showcase portfolio*

### [Solo portfolio](../Projects/David%20and%20Goliath.md) *Solo*
The portfolio presented my work but didn't focus on justifying design choices. The gifs were nice though.

### [Duo portfolio](../Projects/ALND%20(duo%20project).md) *Duo*
The duo portfolio focused a little bit more on why I did certain things. But it still wasn't enough. part of the problem was that I didn't ask enough How or Why questions during this project, same as the solo project.

### [Demo presentation](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Presentation.md) *Duo*
During the final demo presentation of the duo project, me and Rik focused on presenting the project in a way that made the impact clear. To do that we used posters, prototype plaques, sales talks, and an interactive demo.

### [Client portfolio](../Projects/Client%20project.md) *Client*
As I'm writing this, I can safely say I've asked feedback for almost every idea I had on how to write the portfolio. I focused on making a logbook oriented towards explaining the projects process whilst talking about more personal aspects in dedicated learning outcome files (like this one). Hope it's better :)

The final demo was incredibly fun and informative. We had a lot of fun setting everything up and enjoyed presenting our project to our project owners, teachers and other students. We were incredibly happy to see other people be interested in our project and our results.

If we focused on this idea earlier in the concepting phase we could have achieved a lot more, but despite that I still feel like we presented our idea in a way that clearly presented our concept.

## Research outcomes
*consolidated experiments and their results, i.e. in a video, poster presentation, essay and/or 2-page-paper*

### [First demo](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z) *Client*
During the first Sprint delivery I presented our concept and walked through the Storyboard.

### [Second demo](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z) *Client*
In this demo I presented my findings of my scanner location research on both first and second iterations as well as the contextual awareness part I tested. I finished my part by presenting an interactive demo that includes some of mine and Kim's research results.

## **Reflections*
*review of your own experience of and development during the semester, both from a personal and professional point of view*
