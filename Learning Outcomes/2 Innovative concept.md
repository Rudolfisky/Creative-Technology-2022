# Criterion Long Description
**You discover and define an innovative concept using creative thinking techniques combined with research of technology, context and human.**

**Discover** = gain insights through preliminary research (also see ‘Research of ...’)

**Define** = critical evaluation of a variety of concepts

**Innovative** = featuring something new, different and/or better

**Concept** = a clear statement, vision and strategy, i.e. on a potential application of a certain technology

**Using creative thinking techniques** = critical and creative thinking as a process towards innovation
Research of...

**technology** = explore distinctive threats & opportunities, failures & success, i.e. from literature, through experiments, etc.

**context** = understand chances and limits, i.e. spatial, temporal, physical, cultural, societal, ethical, etc.

**human** = understand cognitive mechanisms in relation to human behavior, decision making and needs.

# This semester

For my first project I came up with a concept pretty quickly. What I didn't do, is properly define my concept or do preliminary research on my concept. This led to a very poor learning experience.

During the Duo project I decided to at least document my impact and concept on the main project page. A part from that I also decided to test out user interaction in the form of a A/B user tests. The result was surprising, but we ignored the result. We realized that one of the tested options was a better fit simply because it fits better with the targeted impact, making the tests useless.

During my Client project I wanted to learn from my past shortcomings. I started of with brainstorming a bunch of different ideas with the group, seeing which ones we should focus on, and then doing research on those. I took part in our concept research later on. After refining our impact into a more solid concept we wanted to setup research questions surrounding those uncertainties. I took part in researching the possible technologies we could use in order to implement our solution and which one would be a better fit by comparing them. Based on this research and feedback form product owners we decided to focus on a mobile application. Afterwards we all came together to discuss our findings and revisit our concept and strengthen it.
