**You express your own vision on future scenarios through research of the evolution of mankind’s relationship with technology.**

Vision on future scenarios = your well-informed perspective on possible future scenarios, based on the way you view, value and judge any issues that may arise in its context

**Evolution** = development throughout past, present and future

**Relationship with technology** = interplay, both physically and mentally, i.e. “how does technology change the world / yourself?”

*Your vision is expressed in the concepts, subsequent deliverables and products you produce. During the semester your vision will develop, i.e. by changing direction or reinforcing its basis.*

During the client project, I fell in love with our predict owners, First Impression, vision on Phygital(physicals and digital) in-store solutions. 

In the future I hope to see many more interactive in-store experiences (and maybe even work on them). In an ideal world, each store would have interactive solutions to help the customer select product like cars, pants or even perfume.
