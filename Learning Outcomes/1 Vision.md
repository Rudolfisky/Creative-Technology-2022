# Criterion Long Description
**You express your own vision on future scenarios through research of the evolution of mankind’s relationship with technology.**

Vision on future scenarios = your well-informed perspective on possible future scenarios, based on the way you view, value and judge any issues that may arise in its context

**Evolution** = development throughout past, present and future

**Relationship with technology** = interplay, both physically and mentally, i.e. “how does technology change the world / yourself?”

*Your vision is expressed in the concepts, subsequent deliverables and products you produce. During the semester your vision will develop, i.e. by changing direction or reinforcing its basis.*

# Progress
During my Solo and Duo projects I wanted to create an impact by using a satirical approach to subject like automation or laziness via technology. 

![DG vision board](../Media/vision%20board.jpg)

My first project I focused on making people question automation via a funny, satirical project I called David and goliath(i came up with the name when making concept art)

![DG concept art](../Media/concept%20art%20DG.jpg)

A useless box makes people laugh because of it's near meaningless functionality and user interaction.
Using the concept of a useless box and automating that procedure via another useless box would remove the user interaction part making it even more useless (and maybe funny). But the main focus was on impacting the way people view automation. Automation is a great tool, but by removing the human aspect one can also remove core futures, experiences.

<!-- whats the effect van tech gebruiken om impact te maken: satirisch. gebruik userstories -->

During the client project, I fell in love with our predict owners, First Impression, vision on Phygital(physicals and digital) in-store solutions. 

In the future I hope to see many more interactive in-store experiences (and maybe even work on them). In an ideal world, each store would have interactive solutions to help the customer select product like cars, pants or even perfume.

# Tech will doom us all
It doesn't take a genius to realize that technology can be incredibly dangerous and should be both feared and admired. It is what drives great men to create greatness and greedy men to create misery.

What separates these people is their motivation for creating technology based solution. One inventor might develop a means of transportation like the [first car](https://group.mercedes-benz.com/company/tradition/company-history/1885-1886.html)(1885) and compare it to the first [weaponized car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_car_(military)#/media/File:Simms_Motor_Scout_from_Autocar.jpg)(1898). Here's a side by side:

Whilst the other sees a means to make money by weaponizing it. A prime example of using technology to create value for yourself rather then trying to create value for society as a whole. 

Some might defend the idea of creating weapons, seeing them as a necessary means to an end. The end being either protecting or imposing ideals. 

Modern weaponry like long distance nuclear missiles is a prime example of weapons development ([arms race 1942-1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_arms_race)) that ended up holding the world hostage. Even though the average joe doesn't realize it, we are at a constant threat nuclear anhelation. Of course this is something most world leaders try to avoid due to the [MAD (Mutual assured destruction) doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction). still, It's nightmare fuel.
