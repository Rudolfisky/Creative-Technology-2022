# Prototypes
*You collaboratively realize and test a series of prototypes and its potential, for both users and stakeholders, in real-world application.*

<hr/>

## Realize 
*combine hardware and software based on functional and user requirements, i.e. using appropriate sensors, actuators, logic components, computing platform, protocols, software libraries, etc. resulting in your own software running on your own hardware setup*

### [Making the arm](../Projects/David%20and%20Goliath.md) *Solo*
Making the arm required hardware in the form of servos, a switch, and a micro controller and an piece software to control the servo and read the switch state.

### [Screen component](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z) *Client*
for this component I relapsed a set of POC and a set of prototypes based on requirements.

<hr/>

## Series of prototypes 
*a number of iteratively improved prototypes, from low towards high fidelity. Iterations are substantiated from acquired feedback.*

### [Shooting mechanism](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Research/Shooting%20Mechanism.md) *Duo*
I made iterations that should've progressed from low to high fidelity. The problem was that I was focusing to much on getting a good low fidelity prototype instead of focusing on multiple low fidelity prototypes or upping the fidelity of the shooting mechanism

### [Design prototype development](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z), [Design iteration 2](https://www.figma.com/file/mfSndr4DXEdiwT20qK9E4Z/Jumbo-app-proto-1?node-id=0%3A1&t=hQtjfRUIkhsC8hD1-0), and [Interactive demo S2](https://www.figma.com/file/5PxU9PetiykBcUj1u8ToSW/Interactive-Demo?node-id=75%3A429&t=vB9owuHeVEm0bTxH-0) *Client*
I iterated my design multiple times upon research and user feedback (from user testing). In retrospect, I feel that the scanner location on the app I was working on shouldn't have been focused on as much as I did. I also could've started making paper prototypes in order to get a better initial feel for the Figma prototypes.

## Test 
*check whether a prototype achieves the intended effects, both from a user’s, a stakeholder’s and a technical perspective, using appropriate methods, like usability tests and unit tests, and iterating on test results and feedback.*

### [Activation research](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Research/UI%20Manual%20or%20Auto%20activation%20MK1.md) *Duo*
This user test was meant to test whether it was more intuitive for the user to use a button or open their mouth for our device to activate. In hindsight, the test was wasn't useful. After getting unexpected results we decided to ignore them in favor of the open mouth detection idea because it fit more with our impact. if we thought about this before setting up tests we would've realized the testes were lacking use. for future tests I tried to focus on testing things that would provide valuable insight

### [Shooting mechanism](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Research/Shooting%20Mechanism.md) *Duo*
During the final week of the project I tested the viability of the shooting mechanism. The MVP(Minimal Viable Product) should've been better defined in order to create a more defined goal that could've been tested better using actual predetermined tests to gather feedback.

### [Design prototype development](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z), [Design iteration 2](https://www.figma.com/file/mfSndr4DXEdiwT20qK9E4Z/Jumbo-app-proto-1?node-id=0%3A1&t=hQtjfRUIkhsC8hD1-0), and [Interactive demo S2](https://www.figma.com/file/5PxU9PetiykBcUj1u8ToSW/Interactive-Demo?node-id=75%3A429&t=vB9owuHeVEm0bTxH-0) *Client*
This project was tested via user tests. The first iteration was tested via setting up a user scenario and observing what path the user finds more intuitive.
the second prototype focused on a second set of iterations based on the previous test outcomes. this was test by showing a user all possible iterations and asking them how they feel about the iterations.
The final result got processed into a Interactive demo that was presented to the stakeholders in order to get their feedback.


### [Screen component](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AhghFEyrhlMEkZUgffxx-lcGZYmFyw?e=enbb0z) *Client*
For both prototypes made for this project had predefined tests and tested to see if the results met the result requirements. I Think I could have done a better job at setting the requirements for each prototype as well as defining the tests, but the process did help me get a good focus on what I should work towards.
