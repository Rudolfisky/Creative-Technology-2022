# Interactive user experience
*You design an experimental interactive user experience that investigates a technology’s potential and its mutual effect on people.*

<hr/>

## Design 
*create an iteratively improved visual overview of the concept’s physical and technological variables based on a predetermined effect or goal, i.e. (animated) 2D/3D- renders, (moving) storyboards, concept video, lo-fi prototypes, technical drawings, architecture diagram. Designs are frequently iterated upon, based on proactively acquired feedback.*

### [Shooting mechanism](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Research/Shooting%20Mechanism.md) *Duo*
this prototype was continually iterated upon based on the previous prototype. What we didn't do is properly test the viability of the prototypes or work on different components of the project. the only time the project got undertested/ viability tested was near the end of the projects duration.

I continually created iterations of the my scanner design using pre-detriment iteration/ prototype goals that were tested and refined upon from the start research to the interactive demo.

### [Story board](../Media/Client%20Project/storyboard.png), [Story board whiteboard](../Media/Client%20Project/user%20experience%20story.jpg) *Client*
In this process I worked on defining a user story that would present our concept. We left in the extra idea of navigation and presented the whole story board to the clients in order to get feedback and convey our idea.

## Interactive user experience 
*an installation or media product which can be experienced physically, i.e. appealing to multiple senses.*

### [Demo presentation](https://github.com/Rudolfisky/ALND/blob/main/Presentation.md) *Duo*
During our demo of the Duo project we created a setup that would match the users experience at home and combined this with an interactive demo of the prototype. This helped present our impact as well as made it an experience.

### [Interactive demo S2](https://www.figma.com/file/5PxU9PetiykBcUj1u8ToSW/Interactive-Demo?node-id=75%3A429&t=vB9owuHeVEm0bTxH-0) *Client*
For our sprint 2 delivery I worked on creating a interactive demo the client could walkthrough in order to experience what a more functional prototype could achieve.
