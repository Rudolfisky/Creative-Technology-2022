## Personal growth

Lets start of with getting the most difficult part of this semester: the Solo and Duo project.

### Lack of insight on Learning Outcomes
Both these projects where plagued by a lack of insight on the learning outcomes. When I started working on my first project, I was consumed by the idea and started focusing on realizing as much as possible without requesting feedback or stopping to think about the bigger picture or learning outcomes. same thing happened in my duo project.

This i tried fixing within my Client project


### Too complex too quick
During my Client project I Tried to focus heavily on learning outcomes and understanding them. this sometimes provided to be a problem of its own, the QR code prototypes are a great example of me focusing on something because of the Learning outcomes. even though I feel like I learned a lot about prototyping, testing, and interactive user experience, I spend too much time on something that wasn't the most relevant.

If I could re-spend the time i spend on these prototypes, I would spend a lot less time on this subject.

I want to try and focus more on simple solutions to problems and think more about the extend that certain things need to be developed.

### Too present in conversations
I have a tendency to use a lot of words very fast. I'm also very quick to present my opinion on subjects. This proves to be a bit of a problem in general. In the group project I tried to steer the group in directions by being in front of the whiteboard most of the time. But by placing myself in this position, I started drowning out other, more quite, group members. 

I talked to some other group members that seem to have similar problems in order to try and create a environment where everyone can participate in relevant conversations. 

The first solution that came to mind was asking everyone that didn't voice their opinion on certain subject what they thought. But this felt really forced.

Another solution I came up with is creating more space in conversations for other people to give their opinion. This can be done by not immediately jumping on subjects when I have something to say, but waiting for other members to give input.
